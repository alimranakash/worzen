I've created three custom page templates for your WordPress theme:

All pages are fully styled with Tailwind CSS and match your theme's design system.

```php
<div class="text-5xl font-bold text-primary mb-2">50K+</div>
<div class="text-gray-600 text-lg">Active Installations</div>
```

Change the numbers and labels to match your actual stats.

<div class="flex justify-between">
    <span>Monday - Friday:</span>
    <span class="font-semibold">9:00 AM - 6:00 PM</span>
</div>
```

- Description

### Adding Social Media Links (Contact Page)

## 📧 Contact Form Setup

### How It Works

1. **User fills out form** on Contact page
2. **Form submits** to WordPress admin-post.php
3. **Handler function** validates and sanitizes data
4. **Email sent** to site admin email
5. **User redirected** back with success/error message

### Email Configuration

The contact form sends emails to the **WordPress admin email**. To change this:

1. Go to **Settings > General**
2. Update **Email Address**
3. Save changes

### Testing the Contact Form

1. Visit your Contact page
2. Fill out all fields
3. Click "Send Message"
4. You should see a success message
5. Check your admin email for the message

### Troubleshooting Email Issues

If emails aren't sending:

1. **Install WP Mail SMTP plugin:**
   - Go to **Plugins > Add New**
   - Search for "WP Mail SMTP"
   - Install and activate
   - Configure with your SMTP settings

2. **Check spam folder** - WordPress emails often go to spam

3. **Test with a different email** - Some hosts block certain emails

## 📝 Adding Blog Posts

To populate your Blog page with content:

1. Go to **Posts > Add New**
2. Write your post title and content
3. Add a **Featured Image** (recommended size: 800x450px)
4. Select a **Category**
5. Click **Publish**

### Recommended Post Structure

- **Title:** Clear and descriptive
- **Featured Image:** High-quality, relevant image
- **Excerpt:** 2-3 sentences summary
- **Content:** Well-formatted with headings
- **Categories:** Organize by topic
- **Tags:** Add relevant keywords

---

## 🎨 Design Customization

### Changing Colors

All pages use your theme's color scheme defined in `functions.php`:

```php
colors: {
    primary: '#6366f1',    // Indigo
    secondary: '#8b5cf6',  // Purple
    accent: '#ec4899',     // Pink
}
```

To change colors, edit the Tailwind config in `functions.php` (line 164-167).

### Changing Fonts

The theme uses the **Inter** font family. To change:

1. Edit `functions.php` (line 102-107) to load a different Google Font
2. Update Tailwind config (line 169) with new font name

---

## 📱 Responsive Design

All pages are fully responsive:

- **Mobile (< 640px):** Single column, stacked layout
- **Tablet (640px - 1024px):** 2 columns where appropriate
- **Desktop (> 1024px):** Full 3-column grid layouts

Test on different devices to ensure proper display.
