SCREENSHOT PLACEHOLDER

To complete your WordPress theme, you need to add a screenshot.png file.

Requirements:
- File name: screenshot.png
- Dimensions: 1200 x 900 pixels (4:3 ratio)
- Format: PNG
- Location: Root of the theme folder (same level as style.css)

The screenshot should show:
- Your homepage design

You can create this screenshot by:
1. Setting up the theme on a local WordPress installation
2. Taking a screenshot of the homepage
3. Cropping it to 1200 x 900 pixels
4. Saving it as screenshot.png in the theme root

This screenshot will be displayed in the WordPress admin when users browse themes.
